'''
Exiting loops with "break"
* Works the same way in C and Java.
* We use "break" to leave a loop intentionally/forcefully.

# Example 1 – 'for' loop with break
for number in range(1, 11):
    if number == 6:
        break
    else:
        print(number)

print('Exited the loop')

# Example 2 – 'while' loop with break
while True:
    command = input('Type "exit" to quit: ')
    if command == 'exit':
        break
