'''
Loop while

General form:
while boolean_expression:
    // loop execution

*The while block will be repeated as long as the boolean expression is true.
Boolean expressions = any expression that results in true or false.

Example:

num = 5
num < 5

*In a while loop, it becomes important to take care of the stopping criterion (num = num + 1),
otherwise it becomes an infinite loop. So always remember the stopping criterion,
unless an infinite loop is needed (there are some cases like certain games capturing screen updates,
keyboard commands, etc...).

num = 1
while num < 10:
    print(num)
    num = num + 1

answer = ''
while answer != 'yes':
    answer = input('Did you receive it? ')
