"""
Lists work similarly to vectors / arrays, but with important differences.
They are dynamic and can store ANY data type.

C / Java:
Arrays are fixed.
Example: an int array with size 5 will always store integers
and can only have up to 5 values.

Python:
- Dynamic: no fixed size, elements can be added as long as there is memory.
- No fixed data type: a list can store different types of data.

Python lists are represented using square brackets: []
